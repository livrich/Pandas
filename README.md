# Overview

I've heard a lot about data analysis, but hadn't ever done much with it before now. I'm still trying to decide what kind of career within tech
I want to have. Thus, I decided to try out some data analytics. I've worked with Python in the past; therefore, learning the Pandas library seemed
like a good place to start.

To get my environment working, all I had to do was download the Pandas library. Thankfully, that wasn't challenging and I didn't run into any problems.
The next step was to find a dataset to work with. Surprisingly, I struggled with this step. I ended up using a D&D dataset that a friend sent me. I
found it equally challenging to decide what questions I wanted to answer using the dataset. Eventually, I arbitrarily picked two questions and moved on.

I then tried to dive into the Pandas library and start learning what I could. I read through some tutorials and articles. I felt like I wasn't understanding
very well, so I decided to start coding. Hoping that applying what I read would help me better understand what I was trying to learn. In some ways, it did.
I learned more about what Pandas was capable of doing. However, I don't think I reached a good enough understanding to apply it to my dataset very well.

I'm pretty sure the code I wrote to filter the dataset, doesn't actually involve the Pandas library. Clearly, there's still more for me to learn about Pandas
before I can say I'm proficient. In the future, I hope to learn more about Pandas and data analytics. Out of everything I've been learning recently, using
Pandas has not been my favorite. However, I think if I understood better, my attitude would probably change.

# Data Analysis Results

Question 1. (Filter) How many spells have a range of 'touch'?
Answer 1. There are a total of 75 touch spells.

Question 2. (Filter) What spells can a Bard use?
Answer 2. There are 123 spells a Bard can use. Run code for a list of possible spells.
